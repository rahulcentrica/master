## Group Appointments Booking
Appointment as a resource represents any bookable appointment at online. `job` will define what type of appointment client is interested in.

Please refer to following [documentation](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/bg-core-appointments/tree/master/doc/appointment-flow.md) in order to understand how the flow works. Flows refered in this documentation will be used frequently in examples below.

Following table illustrates the required relationships for specific type of appointments

| job | required relationships |
| :-- | :----------------------- |
| asv |  service-product-holding |
| smart-acquisition |  order |
| smart-conversion | energy-accounts |
| fv | service-product-holding |
| ib | service-sector, faults |
| chi | addresses, customer |
| hive-installation | service-contract |
| hive-installation-near-boiler | service-contract |
| asv-and-ib | service-product-holding, faults, combined-appointment |
| fv-and-ib | service-product-holding, faults, combined-appointment |

##### Attribute interpretation for smart

+ job: `smart-conversion`, selected-slot:`null`, `bookable: true`, `trackable: false`, `cancellable: false`, `reschedulable: false` --> Appointment returned is valid and is usable to book appointment
+ job: `smart-conversion`, selected-slot:`not null`, `bookable: false`, `trackable: true`, `cancellable: true`, `reschedulable: true` --> Appointment returned is valid and can be modified
+ job: `smart-conversion`, selected-slot:`not null`, `bookable: false`, `trackable: true`, `cancellable: false`, `reschedulable: false` --> Appointment returned is valid, but cannot be modified. It can only be displayed to the customer.
+ job: `smart-conversion`, selected-slot:`null`, `bookable: false`, `trackable: false`, `cancellable: false`, `reschedulable: false` --> Appointment returned is in-valid, hence should not proceed.
+ job: `smart-conversion`, selected-slot:`not null`, `bookable: false`, `trackable: false`, `cancellable: false`, `reschedulable: false` --> Appointment returned is in-valid, hence should not proceed.
+ job: `dumb-meter`, selected-slot:`null/not null`, `bookable: false`, `trackable: false`, `cancellable: false`, `reschedulable: false` --> Already dumb meter job is open and hence should allow to book for smart installation.

Please refer to following [documentation](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/bg-core-appointments/tree/master/doc/appointment-flow.md) in order to understand how the flow works. Flows refered in this documentation will be used frequently in examples below.

> Note: Appointments have many relationships. For ex, `address`, `customer`, `services-account`, `services-products` and `premise`. Below examples contains only the required relationships for that transactions. All other relationships can be null.

> Note : `POST /appointments` would return available slots as included in response. For `smart-acquisition`, the day from which slot should start and duration is maintained as configurable in MS. For `smart-conversion` the start date is always day after current date and duration is configurable. In `/GET appointment-slots` the respective input parameters should be passed to retrieve slots accordingly.
          For IB and ASV-AND-IB jobs we need add `?include=available-slots` to get the available-slots included in POST response.

> Note : For Dyno in Appointments response `reschedulable` attribute will be set to false when a `selected-slot` is `in day` slot, even if DYNO sends `amendable` as true.

##### Tracking status for appointment

| Appointment Stream | Possible tacking Status |
| :-- | :----------------------- |
| Services, Smart | `PLANNED`, `IN_YOUR_AREA`, `ON_OUR_WAY`, `ARRIVED`, `COMPLETED`, `SORRY_WE_MISSED_YOU`, `INVALID`, `NA` |
